# Traffic Signal ðŸš¦

This project simulates a traffic light signaling system using Embedded C. The aim is to replicate the functionality of a real-world traffic light system by controlling light sequences to guide vehicles safely at intersections. The project is ideal for understanding the basics of microcontroller programming, timing functions, and Embedded C.

## Overview
In this project, a microcontroller is programmed to control the lighting sequence of a traffic signal, cycling through red, yellow, and green lights in a timed manner to simulate real-life traffic control. Each light is set for a specific duration, reflecting typical traffic signaling to ensure smooth vehicle movement and improved safety at intersections.

## Key Features
- **Traffic Light Sequence:** Red, Yellow, and Green lights operate on a specific timing cycle.
- **Embedded C Programming:** All functions are implemented in Embedded C, offering low-level hardware control.
- **Microcontroller Control:** The project is designed for a microcontroller-based system, commonly used in embedded systems.
- **Realistic Timing:** Light durations mimic actual traffic light timing for effective simulation.

## Project Goals
- To demonstrate the use of Embedded C in creating real-world applications.
- To understand the principles of traffic light control systems.
- To practice timing functions and sequential programming in embedded systems.

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (e.g., AVR, PIC, or ARM)
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Resistors
- Breadboard and connecting wires
- Power source (e.g., USB, battery)

## Software Requirements
- Embedded C programming environment (e.g., Keil, MPLAB, or Atmel Studio)
- Microcontroller programming tools (e.g., programmer/debugger)

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:** The microcontroller is programmed to set up the LEDs and define timing intervals for each light.
2. **Cycle Execution:** The lights follow a timed sequenceâ€”starting with green for "Go," then switching to yellow for "Caution," and finally red for "Stop."
3. **Continuous Loop:** The cycle repeats indefinitely, imitating the functionality of a standard traffic signal.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate sensors to dynamically adjust timing based on real-time traffic flow.
- Expand to include additional features like countdown timers.
